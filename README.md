This project is a small mobile application that I am building called AisleFinder. The main purpose of the app is to help users find items inside a supermarket by searching for a product and then being guided to its location on the map screen. The idea is that instead of walking around looking for items, the user can search for what they need and see where it is located in the store. I am working on the app gradually and adding features one at a time so that the progress is clear and consistent when I commit my work to GitHub.

The first part of the project focuses on setting up the basic structure using React Native. This includes creating a login screen, a search screen and a map screen, as well as making sure navigation between them works correctly. At this stage, the login screen allows the user to enter an email and password before accessing the main part of the app. The search screen allows the user to type in the name of an item they are looking for.

After the basic screens and navigation are working properly, I will start improving the search functionality. The app will eventually store information about products such as their name, which aisle they are in and which section of the store they belong to. At first this information may be mocked or hard coded, but later versions of the app could use a proper data source. When an item is searched, the app should be able to return useful information and guide the user towards the correct aisle.

The map screen will be developed alongside the search feature. It will show a simple layout of a store and will be used to visually guide the user to the location of the item they searched for. As the project develops further, the map may become more detailed or interactive, for example by highlighting specific aisles or showing a clearer route.

I am building this project in small steps rather than all at once. Whenever a new feature is added or an improvement is made, even if it is quite small, I will commit it straight away. This should result in a GitHub history that clearly shows how the project has developed over time instead of large gaps between changes.

As the project continues, I may add extra features such as favourites, recent searches or a simple shopping list. These features will only be added once the existing parts of the app are working as expected. By the end of the project, the repository should clearly show the development process and demonstrate how AisleFinder was built to help users locate items more easily in a store.
